/*	Program name: Euler009
 * 
 *	PROBLEM
 * 	--------
 * 	There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
 *  Find the product abc.
 * 
 * 	ANALYSIS
 * 	---------
 * 	Our program will give us the product of the Pythagorean triples which numbers sum 1000
 * 
 *  Inputs: None
 * 	Outputs: An array with the product
 * 
 * 	Requirements: None
 * 
 * 	Pseudocode level 0:
 * 
 * 	BEGIN
 * 		Find a triplet which sums 1000
 * 		IF triplet is Pythagorean
 * 			Calculate it's product
 * 		END_IF
 * 		Print the answer
 * 	ENDMP
